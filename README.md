# Taxi-fare-prediction-Machine-learning-

Competition dataset and code.
Predicting the taxi fare using machine learning algorithms. 
Only the following libraries will be allowed to be used in the competition:

Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Imblearn
NumPy
Pandas
SciPy
Pickle
regex
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Lightgbm
Python in-built libraries can also be used. Using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLTK, word2vec, textblob etc is not allowed.

R2 score is used for evaluation.

The model gave a prediction with accuracy of 0.94561 when tested.

Stacking, KNN, Boosting, Linear regression techniques are used and optimized.
